Concept: Automating a single process needed for building/imaging new laptops.

 hough this is a simple automation, reducing the amount of clicks to map one, if not many, network drives to a couple
 of keyboard strokes will reduce help to speed up processes.


Known bug(s):

- Error handling needed in multiple outcomes. [In Progress]
- Limitation on the ability to add/remove all drives listed simultaneously. 
- Adding feature within a while-True condition for reuse.
